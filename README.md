This is the typical Hangman game where the player has 6 lives to guess a chosen word. The word can either be input by a different user, or randomly chosen from a Wordlist.
You can add your own Wordlist if you like, by creating a text file and making a list with square brackets and commas separating the words. Name it "Wordlist.txt" and you're
good to go. Enjoy!
